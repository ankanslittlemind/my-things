    <h1>This is the main heading.</h1>
    <h2>This is the sub-heading.</h2>
    <h3>HTML has 6 heading tags from h1 to h6.</h3>
    <h4>And as the h number increases, the heading size decreases.</h4>
    <h5>You will notice that heading size is getting smaller.</h5>
    <h6>This is the last size of heading</h6>

    Now we have come to the bosy part of this HTML.
    <br> I have used the break tag to seperate from previous line. Let me find paste some internet content below.
    <p>I have used the paragraph tag here which is different from break tag as it makes the content in this tag a paragraph rather than taking it to the next line.</p>
    <p>This is the last paragraph and the last line of this HTML page.</p>
