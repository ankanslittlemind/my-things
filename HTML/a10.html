        <h4>The five elements of nature:</h4>
        <li><b><u>Space:</u></b> Space defines the gap between two things, and it is also the element of non-resistance. Thus, it talks about how there should be some sort of space maintained between our joints, relationships, thoughts, and so on.</li> <br>
        <li><b><u>Wind:</u></b> The wind signifies the unstable movement, cold and dry. The element must flow perfectly in life to have stability. In case the wind flows rapidly, then it can cause twitching of muscles physically, unstable relationships, flickering
            mind mentally. And in case there is less amount of wind, it can result in a lack of ideas, no bowel movement, low blood pressure, laziness, lack of spark in the relationship.</li><br>
        <li><b><u>Fire:</u></b> Fire signifies heat that makes things mature, assists in melting and purification. If there is an increase of fire, then it can increase the burning of chest, dark urine with burning, anger, aggression, and others. In case
            there is a lack of fire, then it can reduce appetite, diabetes, lack of creativity and even the warmth of the relationship can reduce.</li> <br>
        <li><b><u>Water:</u></b> Water represents coldness. It helps to lubricate and possesses cohesive properties. Water is very flexible and can take any form when poured into any glass. Excess of water, however, can cause swelling in the body. Water also
            represents adaptability and flexibility, which are vital parts of a relationship as a relationship needs adjustments and attachments.</li> <br>
        <li><b><u>Earth:</u></b> The earth is rigid, heavy, and stable. It can hold something and stop something. When there is a lack of Prithvi, then your hairs might fall, teeth might become weak, bones might become brittle, the bleeding might not stop,
            relationships might be unstable. In case there is an excess of it, the digestion can be difficult, tumors might be formed in the body. There needs to be a perfect balance to have a healthy physical, mental, and relationship life.</li> <br>
